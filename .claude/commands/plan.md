# Plan Command

This command invokes the **planner** agent to create a comprehensive implementation plan before writing any code.

## What This Command Does

1. **Restate Requirements** - Clarify what needs to be built
2. **Identify Risks** - Surface potential issues and blockers
3. **Create Step Plan** - Break down implementation into phases
4. **Wait for Confirmation** - MUST receive user approval before proceeding

## When to Use

Use `/plan` when:

- Starting a new feature
- Making significant architectural changes
- Working on complex refactoring
- Multiple files/components will be affected
- Requirements are unclear or ambiguous

## How It Works

The planner agent will:

1. **Analyze the request** and restate requirements in clear terms
2. **Break down into phases** with specific, actionable steps
3. **Identify dependencies** between components
4. **Assess risks** and potential blockers
5. **Present the plan** and WAIT for your explicit confirmation

## After Confirmation

Once the user confirms the plan:

1. **Create a feature branch** before making any code changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git checkout -b feature/short-description
   ```

2. Then proceed with implementation

This enables multiple Claude instances to work in parallel.

## Integration with Other Commands

After planning:

- Use `/tdd` to implement with test-driven development
- Use `/build-fix` if build errors occur
- Use `/code-review` to review completed implementation
