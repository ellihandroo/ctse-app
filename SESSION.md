## Where We Left Off

- Claude Code foundational setup complete
- Product specification imported from draft
- Ready to begin Phase 1: Foundation

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Scaffold Vite + React project
2. Configure Tailwind with CTSE custom theme
3. Create design system components (Button, Card, Badge)
4. Build Navbar and Sidebar layout
5. Implement Login page with user selection
6. Set up React Router and UserContext

## Current Branch

`main` (initial setup, no code yet)

## Open Issues / Blockers

- Need CTSE logo as SVG
- Need property images for tokenized assets (or placeholder strategy)
- Need avatar style decision for demo users
